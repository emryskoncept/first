    <h3>various SEO tags in web design </h3>
    <p> Title Tag - The title tag is your main and most important anchor. The <title> element typically appears as a clickable headline in the SERPs and also shows up on social networks and in browsers.</p>
    
        <p> Meta Description Tags - Meta description also resides in the <head> of a webpage and is commonly (though definitely not always) displayed in a SERP snippet along with a title and page URL. Meta descriptions are tags that provide a brief explanation of the content of a page. They often appear below the title tag on SERPs. While meta descriptions aren’t a ranking factor, they can impact your click-through rate (CTR). And bring people to your site. An enticing meta description can increase the likelihood of users clicking on your link.</p>
    
        <p> Heading Tags - Heading tags are HTML tags used to identify headings and subheadings within your content from other types of text (e.g., paragraph text). Header tags, like <h1>, <h2>, and <h3>, help you define each heading and subheading on a page. And help you structure content on all types of pages. Including your homepage, service pages, product pages, blog posts, and more. To make it easier for visitors to read and understand. They also help search engines understand the hierarchy and context of the content. The larger the heading size (H1 > H2), the more important it is to include a keyword or descriptive phrase. Since headings have the potential to be more important than plain text (they help indicate page structure), you should optimize them with keywords when possible. </p>
